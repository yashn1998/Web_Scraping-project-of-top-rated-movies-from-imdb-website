Web scraping refers to the process of automatically extracting data from websites. 
IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is a popular website that provides information about movies, TV shows, actors, and more. 
Web scraping of IMDb can be done using Python or other programming languages.

To perform web scraping on IMDb, you can follow these general steps:

1. Find the IMDb webpage that you want to scrape. In this case, you would want to identify the webpage that lists the movies, TV shows, or actors that you are interested    in.

2. Inspect the HTML code of the webpage to identify the relevant tags and attributes that contain the data you want to extract. For example, if you want to extract the names of the movies, you would look for the HTML tags and attributes that contain those names.

3. Use a web scraping library or tool in Python to extract the data. There are many libraries available for this purpose, such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy. You can use these libraries to parse the HTML code and extract the data you want.

4. Store the extracted data in a structured format, such as a CSV or JSON file, or a database.


NOTE:- web scraping can sometimes violate website terms of service or copyright laws, so you should make sure that you have the legal right to scrape a website before   doing so. Additionally, some websites may have measures in place to prevent scraping, so it's important to be respectful and not overload the website with requests.
